Each line will consist of data related to the offer, taken from the portfolio data, data related to user identity, taken from the profile data, and data related to user interactions with the given offer, derived from the transcript data. This matrix will be the basis for investigating the user - offer interactions. \n",

    "The profile_exp dataframe will be built with one row per user (in principle an expansion of the profile.json data. The expansion will provide features about the user, user details as provided in the original profile data, and aggregated features about the users offer and spending history. This matrix will be used for segmentation analysis of the users and their interactions. \n",

Also, the user doesn't need to have information twice about the same offering, one should hope at least. \n",

Thus, transactions that occurs inside window of more than one offer at the same time will be double booked. This is in principle no problem when focusing on offers by itself, as we cannot really differentiate which offer (at least not immediately) that influence the user the most.
