    "# Build matrices notebooks\n",

Each line will consist of data related to the offer, taken from the portfolio data, data related to user identity, taken from the profile data, and data related to user interactions with the given offer, derived from the transcript data. This matrix will be the basis for investigating the user - offer interactions. \n",

This matrix will be used for segmentation analysis of the users and their interactions. \n",

    "I need to separate each offer the user receives. Each offer will be treated as a unique offering, identified by the offer_id, the user_id. Based on the instructions on the data I am making a few assumptions and create some definitions to limit the solution space. \n",

At the moment we will close our eyes and hope that this is not happening to any users. It would seem counter productive to offer two bogo offers of the same kind at the same time to the same users. Also, the user doesn't need to have information twice about the same offering, one should hope at least. \n",

    "We are also not differentiating if the user has two or more offers at the same time. The aggregated data from transactions during the offer is performed per offer user receives. Thus, transactions that occurs inside window of more than one offer at the same time will be double booked. This is in principle no problem when focusing on offers by itself, as we cannot really differentiate which offer (at least not immediately) that influence the user the most.
